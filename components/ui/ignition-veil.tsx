/**
 * The opening ritual. On a visitor's first arrival at the homepage, the whole
 * page - header included - holds in near-darkness while a single ember
 * catches at the flagship's own mark and blooms outward, lighting the room
 * into view. Once per browser session; instantly skipped under reduced
 * motion or on any page but the homepage (see the inline script in
 * app/layout.tsx, which sets the `data-ignition` attribute before first
 * paint so this never flashes unstyled).
 *
 * This component renders identical markup regardless of state - only the
 * `data-ignition` attribute (set synchronously, pre-hydration) drives the
 * CSS. That keeps SSR/hydration mismatch-free; this effect's only job is to
 * mark the ritual as seen once the sequence finishes playing.
